Detailed:
The game’s visual identity is best described as Salvagepunk Monumentalism — a gritty, photorealistic industrial sci-fi style that blends brutalist architecture with glowing ritualized machinery. Ships resemble floating factories, built from oxidized metal, exposed conduits, and modular slabs that feel both utilitarian and sacred. Machines pulse with visible power, their seams glowing in saturated oranges, magentas, and teals against deep void blues. UI elements echo this theme with angular, metallic frames, distressed fonts, and segmented bars that feel forged rather than designed. The Nexus monument anchors the aesthetic: a towering, alien structure built by players, radiating light and scale like a sci-fi cathedral. Every object, from weapons to terminals, is chunky, purposeful, and visually distinct, emphasizing player agency and progression through tactile, glowing interfaces and monumental construction.
