Extraction Builder

High-Level Pitch
A PvPvE extraction-builder where players operate from a persistent ship base, venture into dangerous zones to gather resources, and return to manually secure their haul. Progression is driven by base construction, power management, and unlockable player abilities, not raw shooting skill alone.
Combat is asymmetric, systemic, and consequence-driven — not a generic shooter.

We are shooting for the building systems in Satisfactory, the extraction loop from Arc Raiders, and the abilities from hero shooters like Marvel Rivals and Overwatch. 

Design Pillars
1. Risk Must Be Earned
Valuable actions expose the player to danger
Safety comes from preparation, not fairness
Players choose when to be vulnerable
2. The Ship Is the Heart of Progression
The ship persists across runs
Resources must be manually unloaded
Ship upgrades unlock new gameplay, not just stats
3. Systems Over Scripts
No scripted “moments”
Emergent gameplay from overlapping systems
PvP happens because someone is doing something valuable
4. Player Expression Through Abilities
Hundreds of unlockable abilities
Abilities are equipped, manufactured, powered, and risked
Losing abilities is possible
Core Gameplay Loop
Prepare on the Ship
Manage power
Equip abilities
Choose loadout
Decide objectives
Deploy to PvPvE Zone
Enter via terminal
Ship remains persistent
Risk Phase
Gather salvage
Fight AI / players
Use abilities with cooldowns
Risk inventory and abilities
Extraction
Return to ship
Inventory is not auto-saved
Unload Inventory
Player must manually unload salvage
Salvage moves to ship stash
Failure means loss
Upgrade & Expand
Build new rooms
Unlock new abilities
Improve systems (power, tethering, practice range)
Repeat — with compounding complexity.
Player Inventory & Salvage
Personal Inventory
Exists per run
Lost on death
Must be manually unloaded
Ship Stash
Persistent
Safe
Used for crafting, power, and unlocks
Important:
Returning with nothing is valid and expected.
Death & Failure Rules
Death in PvPvE:
Lose all personal inventory
Lose equipped abilities (design TBD)
Return to ship empty-handed
Death is not a game-over
Failure informs future preparation
Abilities System (Major Differentiator)
Core Ideas
Abilities are:
Unlockable
Equipable
Manufacturable
Power-dependent
Losable
Examples (Conceptual)
Mobility
Utility
Area control
Information warfare
Resource manipulation
Design Intent
Not “classes”
Not fixed loadouts
High build diversity
Counterplay-focused
Base Building & Power System
Ship Rooms
Practice range
Ability manufacturing
Power generation
Storage
Specialized systems (tether, scanners, etc.)
Power
Limited resource
Must be generated
Rooms require power to function
Forces prioritization
Power is a strategic constraint, not a timer.
Practice Range
Unlockable ship room
Requires power
Used to:
Test abilities
Experiment safely
Train without loss
Upgradeable:
Targets
AI behaviors
Ability interactions
Tether System (Signature Mechanic)
Concept
Players can tether themselves to the ship and move outside it to:
Repair
Harvest exclusive materials
Install upgrades
Design Opportunities
Risk while exposed
Power consumption
Tether range limits
Emergency cut-offs
PvP vulnerability
This system is expandable and central to identity.
PvP Philosophy
PvP is contextual
Players fight over:
Resources
Positioning
Timing
Exposure
Not:
Pure aim duels
Symmetrical arenas
Fair starts
Multiplayer Scope (Deferred)
Core mechanics built single-player first
Multiplayer added once systems are solid
No networking compromises early design
Non-Goals (Important)
Not a battle royale
Not a pure shooter
Not a survival sandbox clone
Not an esport
Why This Game Exists
Most extraction games:
Reward shooting first
Punish creativity
Flatten playstyles
This game:
Rewards preparation
Encourages experimentation
Creates stories through systems
Makes failure meaningful but not punishing
Document Status
Living document
Updated as systems stabilize
Serves as design guardrails
If you want next, we can:
Convert this into a 1-page pitch
Break abilities into formal categories
Define the MVP feature cut
Or diagram how power, abilities, and risk intersect
Just say which.
