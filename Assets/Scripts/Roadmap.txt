  - Equipment Terminal/Stash errors after deploy
  - Fabricator progress bar not updating UI
  - PlayerWeapons equip/unequip logic sync bug
  - Inventory opens over other menus (TAB key blocking)
  - Gun fires when player frozen
  - Craft cancel consumes materials (should refund or prevent)
  - Building placement allows interactions (should block)
- One complete scenario
  - Tutorial flow (Place Reactor → Craft Dash → Deploy → Return)
  - First challenge/milestone path
  - Playable end-to-end
- Machine/building systems
  - Equipment terminal powered (gating ability equip)
  - Ship building terminal powered (gating machine placement)
  - Implement machine disassembly (return salvage cost when destroying placed machines)
- Legacy cleanup (optional for PHASE 1, can defer)
  - Remove legacy salvage integer system (fields `runSalvage`, `stashSalvage`)
  - Remove legacy `ItemCost` salvage path in recipes; migrate all recipes to `materialInputs` only
  - Delete legacy fallback in `FabricatorMachine` salvage branches
  - Remove unload flow or convert to material-based pickups
  - Verify Equipment/Inventory UI no longer references salvage
Outcome: Playable single-player game; core loop validated.

PHASE 1.5 — Pre-Networking Decision (1 week | Target: April 16, 2026)
Goal: Understand technical requirements before committing to a networking stack.
- Performance profiling
  - Measure bandwidth per player action (item pickup, ability use, building placement)
  - Measure latency tolerance (how much delay breaks gameplay?)
  - Profile CPU/memory at 2, 4, 8 player counts
- Stress testing
  - Simulate 4 players in same extraction zone
  - Measure desync on high-latency connections (200ms+)
  - Test edge cases (rapid ability spam, simultaneous building placement)
- Finalize networking stack decision
  - Based on bandwidth + latency data, choose: Photon, PlayFab, Netcode for GameObjects, Fusion, or custom
  - Document reasoning + architecture sketch
- Backend architect (informed by prototype)
  - Design player account structure (ID, cosmetics, progression, stats)
  - Schema: extraction sessions, matchmaking queue, leaderboard data
  - API endpoints: register, login, save progress, matchmake
  - Choose backend service (Firebase, PlayFab, custom Node.js + PostgreSQL)
  - Set up dev environment + deployment pipeline
- Authentication system design
  - OAuth flow (Steam? Custom?)
  - Session tokens + expiry logic
  - Anti-cheat hooks (detect impossible stats, rate-limit actions)
  - Plan account recovery + security measures
Outcome: Networking choice locked with data backing it; backend architecture ready.

PHASE 2 — Networking Foundation (Months 3–4 | Target: June 9, 2026)
Goal: Get players into the same world reliably.
- Client–host architecture (based on PHASE 0 decision)
- Player movement sync
- Interaction sync
- Item pickup sync
- Container sync
- Basic lobby/host/join
- Disconnect handling + reconnect logic
Outcome: Two players can run around and interact with the world without desync.

PHASE 3 — Networked Core Systems + Authority (Months 7–10 | Target: February 9, 2027)
Goal: Everything critical is network‑safe and server‑authoritative.
- Inventory fully networked
- Containers fully networked
- Resource nodes networked
- Extraction events networked
- Stash updates networked
- Server authority rules (cheat prevention)
- Anti‑cheese logic (validation, rate limiting)
- Basic matchmaking backend
Outcome: Core loop works in multiplayer without exploits.

PHASE 4 — Raid Mechanics & PvP (Months 11–13 | Target: May 9, 2027)
Goal: Add competitive extraction and PvP stakes.
- Ranked Extraction Mode (endgame competition after Nexus completion)
- PvP progression system (separate ladder, seasonal prestige)
- Ability loss on player death (creates PvP stakes)
- Weapon loot from killed players (drops into world)
- Risk/reward of carrying consumables into extraction zones
- Leaderboard UI for ranked events
- Kill statistics tracking
- Team balancing in extraction zones
Outcome: PvP-forward players have a competitive progression path.

PHASE 5 — Crew Systems & Ship Sharing (Months 14–16 | Target: August 9, 2027)
Goal: Enable collaborative building and team gameplay.
- Crew access with role permissions (Owner/Builder/Visitor)
- Time-limited and contract-based access options
- Ship layout sharing (invite-only gating)
- Co-building UI (showing who is building what)
- Shared resource spend caps per crew member
- Multiple ships per player (maintain 3–5 builds)
- Social hub scene for crew meetups
- Player avatars + cosmetic slots
- Friend invites + friend list
Outcome: Builder-focused players can collaborate on ship design; friend groups can cooperatively manage a shared vessel.

PHASE 6 — Robot & Autonomous Playstyle (Months 17–20 | Target: December 9, 2027)
Goal: Enable non-combat/commander-focused progression.
- Robot manufacturing system (build robots from materials)
- Robot deployment into extraction zones (autonomous extraction)
- Robot upkeep + power consumption (strategic cost)
- Robot module choices (e.g., harvester, scout, combat)
- Autonomous PvE pressure (robots create world events)
- Commander progression path (focus on robot optimization, not personal combat)
- Robot status UI (deployed, returning, harvesting)
- Commander cosmetics (armor, upgrades, customization)
- Non-combat milestone path (complete by robot stats, not kills)
Outcome: Non-PvP/non-builder players have a viable, engaging progression loop.

PHASE 7 — Post-Season Systems & Progression (Months 21–23 | Target: March 9, 2028)
Goal: Add seasonal resets with permanent account rewards.
- Expeditions/retirement system (end-of-season archival)
- Permanent account rewards (cosmetics, extra ship slot, +1 ability slot)
- Blueprint persistence (researched blueprints carry forward account-wide)
- Salvage conversion (10% of final season salvage → startup salvage next season)
- Seasonal prestige badges + veteran cosmetics
- Season rankings + leaderboard reset
- Challenge + milestone system extended across seasons
- Basic text chat + emotes in social hubs
Outcome: Players can retire with prestige and reset cleanly for a fresh seasonal experience.

PHASE 8 — Art, UI, and World Production (Months 24–27 | Target: July 9, 2028)
Goal: Replace placeholders with final assets (Salvagepunk aesthetic).
- Final UI (your Salvagepunk industrial style: orange/rust/glow with brutalist design)
- Final item icons + weapon models (chunky, purposeful, visually distinct)
- Final environment kit (ship interior, extraction zones, industrial sci-fi)
- Final props, machines, containers (modular, oxidized metal, exposed conduits)
- Nexus monument visual design (towering alien structure, radiating light, player-scale)
- Lighting + post-processing (glow seams in orange/magenta/teal, void blues)
- FX pass (ability VFX, weapon trails, impacts, power seams)
- Sound design + music (ritualistic, industrial ambience)
Outcome: The game embodies Salvagepunk Monumentalism; every object feels crafted and meaningful.

PHASE 9 — Content Expansion & World Variety (Months 28–30 | Target: October 9, 2028)
Goal: Add enough depth for a full release.
- More items + item tiers (Tier 3/4 weapons, advanced abilities, cosmetics)
- More resource types + harvesting mechanics (10+ material types with distinct visual themes)
- More hazards + environmental challenges (faction bases, anomalies, dynamic events)
- More machines + building variety (10+ tiers from Refinery to Research Terminal)
- Multiple extraction zones with distinct aesthetics and loot tables
- Guilds + clan systems (shared stash, clan progression)
- Non-combat social hubs (trading posts, workshops, arenas)
Outcome: A content‑complete game with high replay value and cosmetic diversity.
